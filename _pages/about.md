Hello/Hola! My name is Ulises Hernández, I am a PhD student working in population genetics at the [Masel lab](https://www.masellab.org/people/joanna-masel) at the University of Arizona. I grew up in San Luis Potosí, México where I got my M.Sc. in Mathematical modeling and a B.Sc. in Biophysics from Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, México. My research interests focus on understanding the emergence of genome complexity such as modularity, plasticity and genome bloating. 

PS: I am still developing my website. More contents coming soon....
